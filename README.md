# Introduction to Power Supplies
A power supply is an electronic device that provides a required amount of power to an electrical load. It converts a source of electrical energy into the desired form, such as a voltage or current, to operate different types of electrical devices. Power supplies are used in various applications and are essential components in many electronic systems.

# Types of Power Supplies

  ### AC-DC Power Supplies
  These power supplies convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). They are commonly used to provide regulated DC voltage for electronic devices.

  ### DC-DC Power Supplies
  These power supplies convert direct current from one voltage level to another. They are commonly used in portable electronic devices, as they are compact and           efficient.

  ### Linear Power Supplies
  These power supplies use linear regulators to provide a stable DC voltage output. They are commonly used in low-power applications and are known for their low noise   and stability.

  ### Switching Power
  Supplies: These power supplies use high-frequency switching to convert AC or DC input into a regulated DC output. They are commonly used in high-power applications     due to their high efficiency and small size.

  ### Battery-Based Power Supplies
  These power supplies use batteries as the source of energy. They are commonly used in portable electronic devices, such as laptops and smartphones, as they provide a   source of power when there is no access to AC power.

# Applications of Power Supplies in Real World

  ### Computers 
  Power supplies are used in computers to provide regulated DC voltage to operate the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and other components.

  ### Consumer Electronics 
  Power supplies are used in consumer electronics, such as televisions, DVD players, and gaming consoles, to provide regulated DC voltage to operate the device.

  ### Medical Equipment
  Power supplies are used in medical equipment, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) machines and defibrillators, to provide regulated DC voltage to operate the device.

  ### Industrial Equipment
  Power supplies are used in industrial equipment, such as factory automation systems, to provide regulated DC voltage to operate the equipment.
